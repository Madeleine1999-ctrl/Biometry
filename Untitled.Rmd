## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)


library(tidyverse)
library(tableone)
library(gtsummary)


```

```{r}
ttnc <- read_csv(file = "Titanic_Dataset.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```
```{r}
ttnc <- ttnc |>
  mutate(
    Survived = factor(Survived, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    Pclass = factor(Pclass, levels = c(1, 2, 3), labels = c("1st Class", "2nd Class", "3rd Class")),
    Sex = factor(Sex, levels = c("female", "male"), labels = c("Female", "Male")),
    Embarked = factor(Embarked, levels = c("C", "Q", "S"), labels = c("Cherbourg", "Queenstown", "Southampton"))
