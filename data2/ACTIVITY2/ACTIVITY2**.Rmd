# Step 1: Is daytime sleepiness (ODSI score) different for adherent vs non-adherent #participants from baseline to 6 months?
#      H0: There is no difference in the mean change in ODSI scores between adherent 
# and non adherent participants 
#      H1: There is a difference in the mean change in ODSI scores between adherent 
# and non adherent participants
#
# Step 2: I used a Welch two- sample t test to compare the mean change in ODSI scores
# between the adherent and non adherent groups. a= 0.05.

# Step 3:
```{r odsi_ttest}
# Calculate change in ODSI from baseline to 6 months
Cpap <- Cpap %>%
  mutate(odsi_change = odsi_6m - odsi_bl)

t.test(odsi_change ~ adherence, data = Cpap)


```
# Step 4: Based on the results of the two-sample t-test : (t(55.17) = -1.20, p = 0.236), there was not a large statistical difference in change of ODSI scores between the adherent and non adherent subjects. The adherent subjects improved by 2.95 points, vs the non adherent group that improved by 1.53 points. Although the adherent subjects showed a higher decrease in sleep time, this difference compared to the non adherent group was not significant. Thus, both groups had a similar experience in improvements of sleep from baseline to 6 months, therefore we retain the null hypothesis. 



#3

# Step 1: H0: The probability of subjects having excessive daytime sleepiness with an ODSI score of more than 6 (>6) is the same at baseline and at 6 months.
#         H1: the probability of subjects having excessive daytime sleepiness with an ODSI score of more than 6 (>6) is different at baseline and at 6 months. 

# Step 2: I will use the McNemar's test because this problem has us comparing (2) paired proportions of the same subjects at two of the same time points and these 2 variables are both dichotomous. a= 0.05

          
#Step. 3:
```{r}
Cpap <- Cpap %>%
mutate(
odsi_high_bl = ifelse(odsi_bl >= 6, 1, 0),
odsi_high_6m = ifelse(odsi_6m >= 6, 1, 0)
)

table_sleepiness <- table(Cpap$odsi_high_bl, Cpap$odsi_high_6m)
mcnemar.test(table_sleepiness)

```
#Step 4: If we use a significant level of a= 0.05, and p<0.05 we will reject the null hypothesis because p= 0.009722. 

#Step 5: There was a significant change in the variation of subjects who experienced excessive daytime sleepiness from baseline to 6 months being that p= 0.0097. This means that the odds of subjects having excessive daytime sleepiness decreased after 6 months. This makes sense and suggests that the CPAP treatment could have helped reduce daytime sleepiness over the course from baseline to 6 months.

#A.
# Step 1: H0: The population mean of MMSE is equal to 23, μ = 23 (not cognitvely impaired)
#         H1: The population mean of MMSE is less than 23, μ < 23 (cogntively impaired)

#Step 2: I will use the z test to calculate this, p=0.05

#Step 3:
```{r}

sigma <- 2


xbar <- mean(Cpap$mmse)
n <- length(Cpap$mmse)
mu0 <- 23  # hypothesized mean


z <- (xbar - mu0) / (sigma / sqrt(n))


p_value <- pnorm(z)


z; p_value

```
# Step 4: If we set the criterion that p= 0.05, being that p > 0.05 in this z test (p= 1). We would fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

# Step 5:  Since our z test statistic was well above 23 (z = 30), and our p value was 1, we can conclude that there is no proof that the average MMSE score is below 23 and that there is no coginitive impairment. The average is much higher, thus, this group has strong cognitive abiltiies. 

#B. 
# Step 1: H0: The population mean of MMSE is equal to 23, μ = 23 (not cognitvely impaired)
#         H1: The population mean of MMSE is less than 23, μ < 23 (cogntively impaired)

# Step 2: I will use the one sample t-test because we do not know the SD. p = 0.05

# Step 3: 
```{r}

t_test_result <- t.test(Cpap$mmse, mu = 23, alternative = "less")
t_test_result

t_stat <- t_test_result$statistic
p_val_t <- t_test_result$p.value
xbar <- mean(Cpap$mmse)
s <- sd(Cpap$mmse)
n <- length(Cpap$mmse)

cat("One-sample t-test (H1: mean < 23)\n")
cat("t = ", round(t_stat, 4), ", df = ", t_test_result$parameter, ", p = ", signif(p_val_t, 3), "\n")
cat("Sample mean =", round(xbar, 3), ", sample SD =", round(s, 3), ", n =", n, "\n")

```
# Step 4: If we set the criterion that p = 0.05, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis because p > 0.05 in these results; p = 1.

# Step 5: The subjects scored a 27.6 on the MMSE on average, which is above the cutoff of 23 that points towards cognitive impairment. This test also found that there was no proof that the groups score on average was below the cutoff of p = 1. Thus, the participants are mentally healthy.

#A. Mean and SD for CPAP use
```{r}
# Replace 'avg_daily_use' with the actual column name if different
mean_use <- mean(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_use   <- sd(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap, na.rm = TRUE)
n_use    <- sum(!is.na(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap))

mean_use; sd_use; n_use

cat("Mean average-daily CPAP use =", round(mean_use, 3),
    "hours; SD =", round(sd_use, 3), "hours; n =", n_use, "\n")

```

#B. CPAP use < 3 hours
```{r}
# Parametric estimate (normal assumption, parameters = sample mean & sd)
prop_lt3_parametric <- pnorm(3, mean = mean_use, sd = sd_use)  # P(X < 3)

# Also compute the empirical proportion from the sample for comparison
prop_lt3_empirical <- mean(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap < 3, na.rm = TRUE)

prop_lt3_parametric; prop_lt3_empirical

cat("Estimated proportion (parametric, Normal) with < 3 hours =", 
    signif(prop_lt3_parametric, 3), "\n")
cat("Observed proportion in sample with < 3 hours =", 
    signif(prop_lt3_empirical, 3), "\n")


```
#C. Interpretation. 
# Based on the test results, participants used their CPAP machines for an average of just over 5 hours per night. The estimated proportion of individuals using the device for less than 3 hours nightly was 19.5%, closely matching the observed rate of 20.6%. This means roughly 1 in 5 subjects had minimal usage, suggesting that a notable portion may not be fully benefiting from CPAP therapy. In contrast, the majority of participants appear to be using the treatment consistently and as recommended.

#A. BMI mean and SD
```{r}

mean_bmi <- mean(Cpap$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_bmi   <- sd(Cpap$bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
n_bmi    <- sum(!is.na(Cpap$bmi))

mean_bmi; sd_bmi; n_bmi


cat("Mean BMI =", round(mean_bmi, 2), "SD =", round(sd_bmi, 2), "n =", n_bmi, "\n")

```
#B Obese subjects; BMI > 30
```{r}

prop_obese_param <- 1 - pnorm(30, mean = mean_bmi, sd = sd_bmi)


prop_obese_emp <- mean(Cpap$bmi >= 30, na.rm = TRUE)

prop_obese_param; prop_obese_emp


cat("Estimated proportion (parametric, Normal) obese =", round(prop_obese_param, 3), "\n")
cat("Observed proportion in sample obese =", round(prop_obese_emp, 3), "\n")

```
#C Interpretation
# The mean BMI among subjects was 42.18, with a standard deviation of 7.21, indicating considerable variability in body weight. Since a BMI of 30 or higher is classified as obese, the average suggests that the majority of participants fell within the obesity range. Both the observed and estimated proportions of obese individuals were approximately 95%, confirming that nearly all subjects were considered obese based on their BMI values.


#7. 
#A. AHI distribution in adherent subjects
```{r}
ahi_adherent <- Cpap$ahi[Cpap$adherence == "Adherent"]

mean_ahi <- mean(ahi_adherent, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_ahi   <- sd(ahi_adherent, na.rm = TRUE)
median_ahi <- median(ahi_adherent, na.rm = TRUE)
range_ahi <- range(ahi_adherent, na.rm = TRUE)

# Boxplot
boxplot(ahi_adherent, horizontal = TRUE,
        main = "Boxplot of AHI among Adherent Participants",
        xlab = "AHI")


```

# In the distribution of AHI scores among adherent participants, values ranged from 15 to 113, with a mean of approximately 34.5. Most participants had scores within a moderate range, though a few exhibited notably high values. This indicates substantial variability in baseline AHI measurements within the adherent group. The histogram reveals a right-skewed distribution, while the boxplot highlights several high scores and distinct outliers, further emphasizing the presence of extreme values in the data.

# If we repeatedly drew samples of 30 adherent participants, the resulting sample means would cluster around 34.52, with a standard error of approximately 3.62. In this case, the sampling distribution would be roughly normal in shape and noticeably narrower than the distribution of individual AHI index scores. Being that the sample mean is based on multiple people, the spread of this distribution is smaller than the standard deviation of AHI index score data. Overall, these scores only differ slightly around the overall mean.

# IV. This empirical sampling distribution closely resembles a normal curve, with a mean of 34.72 and a standard deviation of 3.87. Compared to a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation, it matches closely. The shape is bell-shaped and symmetric. While the original AHI scores are somewhat skewed, the sampling distribution of the means is approximately normal, as predicted by the Central Limit Theorem.
# V. When comparing the empirical sampling distribution to the theoretical distribution from Problem B, both histograms appear very similar, with each centered around the same mean. Their standard deviations are slightly different (3.88 vs 3.62). With the SD of the adherent sampling distribution being larger, this tells us that the variability in the sample means larger. Overall, both problems indicate normal distributions and we can conclude that versus the individual AHI index scores, the sample means is more consistent and reliable.

# For non-adherent participants, the sampling distribution of the mean AHI for samples of size 100 is approximately normal, centered at a mean of 35.60 with a standard error of 1.97. The distribution is bell-shaped and balanced, indicating that most sample means cluster tightly around the population mean. Even if the original individual AHI scores are somewhat skewed, the averages of large samples usually tend to be more consistent and follow a normal pattern via the CLT.

# IV. The empirical sampling distribution for the AHI index had a mean of 35.67 and a standard deviation of approximately 1.98. This sampling example closely matches that of a normal distibution. This sampling example illustrates a bell shape curve and a proportional alignment. Through drawing larger sample sizes, the sample means is more evenly balanced than the original AHI index scores. 
# V. The empirical mean and standard deviation closely mirror those from Part D, with both distributions centered from around 35.59-35.67 and showing a similar spread of approximately 1.97 to 1.98. Additionally, both distributions exhibit a roughly normal shape. This strong alignment reinforces the accuracy of the theoretical model in predicting how sample means behave when repeatedly drawing large samples from non-adherent participants.

#F. When comparing the sampling distributions of AHI between adherent and non-adherent participants, the overall mean was slightly higher for the non-adherent group (35.67) compared to the adherent group (34.73). The standard deviation of the sampling distribution was larger for adherent participants (SD = 3.88) and smaller for non-adherent participants (SD = 1.98), indicating greater consistency in sample means among the non-adherent group. This difference in variability is primarily due to the disparity in sample sizes—100 for non-adherent versus 30 for adherent participants. Larger samples tend to produce more stable and less variable averages. Overall, both distributions approximate a normal shape, but the non-adherent group's distribution is narrower and more precise.
