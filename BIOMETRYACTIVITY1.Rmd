## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1 There is a data entry error for finding the ages of the dataset. I ran the code hist(x = Cpap$age) in the console; I find that there are ages above 500 all the way to 600 in this data set, which is not possible. 

hist(Cpap$age)

weirdAges <- which(Cpap$age >= 100)
print(x = weirdAges)
Cpap$age[weirdAges]
removeAges <- which(Cpap$age > 110)
Cpap <- Cpap[-removeAges, ]
hist(Cpap$age)

#2 When looking at the table for race_white using (table(Cpap$race_white)), I find that there is a third column labeled "q". When in the data dictionary it indicates that there should only be 2 columns: 1 = yes, 0 = no

table(Cpap$race_white)

removerace_white <- which(Cpap$race_white == "q")
Cpap$race_white[removerace_white] <- NA
table(Cpap$race_white)

#3 When looking at the table for race_other using (table(Cpap$race_other)), I find that there is a third column labaled "p". When in the data dictionary it indicates that there should only be 2 columns: 1 = yes, 0 = no

table(Cpap$race_other)
removerace_other <- which(Cpap$race_other == "p")
Cpap$race_other[removerace_other] <- NA
table(Cpap$race_other)


#4 When looking at the table for sex using (table(Cpap$sex)), I find that there are 3 columns: 0, 1, 2 with corresponding numbers of sex under each column. When the data dictionary indicates that there should only be 2 columns for sex: 1 = female and 0 = male 

table(Cpap$sex)
removesex <- which(Cpap$sex == 2)
Cpap$sex[removesex] <- NA
table(Cpap$sex)

#5 When looking education using (table(Cpap$education)), I find that there is a missing value indicated in the table showing a 1. 
table(Cpap$education)

removeeducation <- which(Cpap$education == "")
Cpap$education[removeeducation] <- NA
table(Cpap$education)


#6 When looking at the histogram graph for ess (Measure of day time sleepiness) using hist(x = Cpap$ess), the information for values 25-30 are inaccurate because it is indicated on the data dictionary that the maximum possible number of daytime sleepiness is 24, when on the x-axis it reaches over 24 to 30. 

hist(x = Cpap$ess)
weirdess <- which(Cpap$ess >= 24)
print(x = weirdess)
Cpap$ess[weirdess]
removeess <- which(Cpap$ess > 24)
Cpap <- Cpap[-removeess,]
hist(Cpap$ess)

#7 When looking at the histogram graph for avg daily cpap using (hist(x = Cpap$avg_daily_cpap)) we find that there is a value of over 20 hours of sleep which is an obvious outlier in the data. 

hist(x = Cpap$avg_daily_cpap)
weirdavg_daily_cpap <- which(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap >= 20)
print(x = weirdavg_daily_cpap)
Cpap$avg_daily_cpap[weirdavg_daily_cpap]
removeavg_daily_cpap <- which(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap > 20)
Cpap <- Cpap[-removeavg_daily_cpap,]
hist(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap)


#8 When looking at subject ID for the dataset using (table(Cpap$subject_id)), I find that there is a duplicate subject ID. In order to find the duplicate ID, I ran the (duplicate(x = Cpap$subject_id)), and find that under line 122 there is one value that shows TRUE instead of FALSE. 
table(Cpap$subject_id)
duplicated(x = Cpap$subject_id)
which(x = duplicated(x = Cpap$subject_id))
print(x = Cpap[118:125, ])


#Race == combining race variables 
Cpap$race <- ifelse(Cpap$race_black == 1, "Black",
ifelse(Cpap$race_white == 1, "White",
ifelse(Cpap$race_other == 1, "Other", NA)))

print(x = Cpap$race)
table(Cpap$race)

#Avg_daily_cpap == creating "adherence variable"

Cpap$adherence <- ifelse(Cpap$avg_daily_cpap >= 4, "Adherent", "Non-Adherent")

print(x = Cpap$adherence)

# Examining shape of AHI in terms of shape and skew 

hist(Cpap$ahi)

# Using the histogram function for Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) (hist(Cpap$ahi)), using base R I see that this histogram is a positively right skewed distribution. The shape of the histrogram is regular and the frequency decreases as the apnea events per hour increases. I see that this display is univariate because the x-axis represents only a single variable. Furthermore, I can also tell that this is univariate being that the y axis shows frequency and there are no groupings shown in the graph.  

# Examining distrubutions of age vs adherence. 

boxplot(Cpap$age)
boxplot(age ~ adherence, 
data = Cpap,
xlab = "Adherence Category",
ylab = "Age",
main = "Age vs Adherence Category")

# Using the box plot function for age vs adherence category I can see that this box plot is bivariate because it is comparing 2 variables (adherent vs non-adherent under age). Being that both box plots are about the same width, I can tell that there is not a wide variety of age differences between the two. I can tell that there is a difference in the IQR between the 2 box plots because the adherent boxplot is taller than the non-adherent box plot. I can also see that for the non-adherent box plot, the top whisker is longer than the top whisker of the adherent box plot, this could show that some non-adherent individuals are older than the rest, and the age distribution may be skewed right.


# Examining distrubutions of race vs adherence.

tab1 <- table(x = Cpap$race)
print(tab1)
barplot(height = tab1,
horiz = FALSE,
ylim = c(0, 200),
xlab = "race",
ylab = "Adherence Category",
main = "Race vs Adherence Category")

# Using the bar plot function to compare distributions of race vs the adherence category, I can see that this is a bivariate display because it shows 3 variables on the x axis (black, other, white). The bar plot shows that there are differences in the height between all 3 for the adherence category. Seeing this I can tell that the race distribution across variables is not consistent across adherence variables. 



#Relationship between ESS and MMSE

plot(Cpap$ess[Cpap$adherence == "Adherent"], Cpap$mmse[Cpap$adherence == "Adherent"],
     col = "blue", pch = 16,
     xlab = "Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)",
     ylab = "Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)",
     main = "ESS vs MMSE by CPAP Adherence")


points(Cpap$ess[Cpap$adherence == "Non-Adherent"], Cpap$mmse[Cpap$adherence == "Non-Adherent"],
       col = "red", pch = 16)

legend("topright", legend = c("Adherent", "Non-Adherent"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), pch = 16)

#To determine the relationship between Ess(Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and MMSE (Mini-Mental State Exam) to adherence and non-adherence I used the scatter plot function to compare the variables. Doing so, I made the adherent plots blue and the non adherent plot red. From looking at the scatter plot you can see that there is no correlation between the ESS and MMSE and their adherent and non-adherent data. To confirm, you can see in the data set that the numbers given for MMSE and ESS are mostly random and vastly different which makes sense seeing the scatterplot I created. This display is Bivariate being that is includes 2 different variables compared to 2 different variables. 


#Creating table 1

install.packages("tableone")
library(tableone)

vars <- c("age", "sex", "race", "avg_daily_cpap", "ess", "mmse", "ahi", "education", "ethnicity")

strata <- "adherence"

table1 <- CreateTableOne(vars = vars, strata = strata, data = Cpap, factorVars = c("sex", "race"))

print(x = table1, showAllLevels = TRUE)


# When finding table 1 for this data set, I can see that there are 127 adherent invididuals and 45 non adherent individuals to CPAP. For sex, you can see that for adherent and non adherent the percentages of male and female are similar. For race, you can see that there is a large percentage (80%) of the adherent individuals that are white vs 50% white for the non-adherent group. For average daily Cpap use, there is significantly more use in the adherent group with a mean of 6.40 hours vs a mean of 1.60 hours for the non-adherent group which makes sense. The mean of ess, mme, and ahi show little differences between adherent vs non-adherent groups. The mean for age was about the same for adherent vs. non-adherent (about 67). The education variable between adherent vs non-adherent showed that for both categories, about 73-80% of individuals had higher than a high school degree.
